    <p>
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken">chicken</a> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl,
        originally from Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird. A younger male may be called a cockerel;
        a
        male that has been castrated is a capon. The adult female bird is called a hen. "Chicken" was originally a term
        only
        for an immature, or at least young, bird, but thanks to its usage on restaurant menus has now become the most
        common
        term for the subspecies in general, especially in American English. In older sources common fowl or domestic
        fowl
        were typically used for this.

        Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
        Hellenistic
        period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BCE).[1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both
        their
        meat and eggs) and as pets.

    <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
    <p>Chickens are omnivores.[23] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and even
        animals
        as large as lizards, small snakes,[24] or young mice.[25]</p>
    <h3>Behavior</h3>
    <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
    <p> are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and
        raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking order", with
        dominant
        individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes
        a
        temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially
        younger
        birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[28] When a rooster finds food, he may call other
        chickens
        to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This
        behaviour may
        also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.</p>
